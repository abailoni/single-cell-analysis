# Similarly to the `pixel_qc` notebook, this notebook assumes that you have already downloaded adata files from metaspace
# using the pixel data download notebook.

general:
  analysis_id: 9AA-vs-DAN-optimization # General identifier of the analysis
  metadata_file: /Users/alberto-mac/EMBL_repos/single-cell-analysis/projects/maldi_opt/mans_9AA_opt/9AA_Optimizationmetadata_masked.csv # Can be CSV, TSV, XLSX or gdrive ID prefixed with 'gdrive:'
  project_description:
    "Comparison between DAN and 9AA matrices using HeLa cells (HeLa control and HeLa + 2DG). For 9AA: 
    
    - methanol instead of ACN (the rest of parameters are the same as DAN)
    
    - mass spec is tuned based on glu, gln
    
    - laser focus was good
    
    - attn tuned to get good response

  # Metadata columns containing batch information: PCA will be done independently for data with different batch values
  # Possible examples are 'matrix' and 'polarization' columns.
  batch_keys:
    - Matrix

  # Optimization parameters:
  optimization_key_1: Matrix # Metadata column containing the first parameter that you optimized
  optimization_key_2: Null # Metadata column containing a second parameter that you optimized (Set to Null or comment out if you only optimized for one parameter)

  # Replicate naming scheme: for example to "{slide}-{row}{col}" or to "{replicate_number}" if repl information is present in metadata columns.
  repl_name: "{Slide Replicate}-{Slide Position}"

  metaspace_dt_id_key: "datasetId" # Metadata column with metaspace ID of the datasets

  masking_key: "mask" # Metadata column to optionally mask datasets if the masking value is truthy
  bio_key: Treatment # Metadata column containing biological labels (treatments, cell types etc.)
  palette: # Color palette for color coding labels & PCAs
    Control: '#b0bc89'

  min_annotations_per_pixel: 10 # Default: 10
